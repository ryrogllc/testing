            <br>
            <br>11.0	CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each party may disclose to the other party information that it designates as confidential or which should be reasonably understood to be confidential under the circumstances (“Confidential Information”).

            <br>
            <br>12.6	No term or provision of this Agreement will be deemed waived and no breach of this Agreement will be deemed consented to or excused, unless such waiver, consent or excuse will be expressed in writing and signed by the party claimed to have so waived, consented or excused such term or provision.

            <br>13.0	DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
            <br>
            <br>A.	“Error” means a failure of the Program to conform to the specifications resulting in the inability to use or a considerable restriction in use of the Program.
            <br>
            <br>B.	“Error Correction” means either a software modification or addition that, when made or added to the Program, corrects the Error, or a procedure or routine that, when observed in the regular operation of the Program, eliminates the practical adverse effect of the Error on End User.
            <br>
            <br>C.	“Program” means all the Pecan Street BluWater Mobile App’s suite of functionality (e.g., mobile application, web portal, web application, and/or related backend systems), as they may be upgraded, enhanced, and/or modified by Licensor, in machine-readable, object code form only.  The Program also includes any subsequent versions that substantially replicate the same functionality even though they may be given a different operating name.
            <br>
            <br>D.	“Third-Party Software” means software of companies other than Licensor that Licensor has licensed to you under this Agreement.

            <br>
            <br>14.0	INJUNCTIVE REMEDIES. In the event you breach or threaten to breach any of the covenants expressed herein, the damage to Licensor will be great and irreparable and difficult to quantify; therefore, Licensor may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief to restrain such breach or threat of breach, without disentitling Licensor from any other relief in either law or equity. The parties hereto agree that venue for any action related to such an action for injunctive or other equitable relief shall solely be in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas and the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and venue of said court.
            <br>PART IV.  PROJECT RESEARCH TERMS
